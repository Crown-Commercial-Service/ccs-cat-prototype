<!-- <p class='govuk-body'><strong>When to use this agreemnet</strong></p>
<p class='govuk-body'>You can use this agreement to find people with the full range of Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) skills needed for a digital transformation/capability project, or to supply individual DDaT staff to work as part of an existing team or new team you’re setting up.</p>
<p class='govuk-body'>A digital transformation project might include redesigning an existing service, or designing a whole new service for your users or your internal teams, for example. It may involve rethinking about how an organisation could use technology, people or processes to create new business models or new revenue streams for the organisation (for example, building mobile applications or ecommerce platforms)</p> 
<p class='govuk-body'>You might want to hire staff with DDaT skills to integrate into your organisation and help to achieve strategic objectives through a single project or multiple projects that may involve user research, design or building and supporting the service, for example.</p>
 <p class='govuk-body'>You may also need DDaT staff for any strategic objectives or scope of services that have no clearly defined outcomes or deliverables that will enable digital transformation.</p> 
 <p class='govuk-body'>Products and services that are out of scope include (but are not limited to)non Digital, Data and Technology roles. <a href='#nottousefor'><strong>You can find out more information about what you cannot use this agreement for</strong></a>.
</p> <p class='govuk-body'>Buyers can find teams of digital specialists based on Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) role definitions that meet the skills and competencies in the <a href="#">Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA).</a></p>
<br>
<p class='govuk-body'><strong>Buyers can choose to use the following accountability models in their procurement:</strong></p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li><strong>Sole responsibility:</strong> the supplier takes full responsibility to deliver any milestones that the buyer needs to achieve. This is similar to the “outcomes” model available through RM1043.7 DOS 5 (digital outcomes and specialists 5). The supplier will need to accept the full risk or responsibility for delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>Self directed teams:</strong> delivery teams will produce work that is requested by the buyer. This type of accountability model suits buyer-led agile development where the specifics of what will be delivered by the supplier is agreed closer to the point of delivery. Some of the risk is carried by the supplier</li>
        <li><strong>Rainbow teams:</strong> where the supplier (or more than one supplier) provides a team of people to work alongside their existing staff. In this model the people, while managed at a high level by the supplier, may also be given direction at an operational level by someone from another organisation.</li>
</ul>
