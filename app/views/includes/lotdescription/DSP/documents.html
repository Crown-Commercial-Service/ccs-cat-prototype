      <li>Joint Schedule 1 <br><a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#" onclick="return false;" ><strong>(Definitions):</strong></a> this is an essential element of your
        contract defining
        significant
        words and phrases used in the Core Terms and template schedules. You should augment the basic content with any
        new definitions specifically required for your contract, documenting these as Special Terms in your Order
        Form.
      </li>
      <li>Joint Schedule 2 <br><a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#" onclick="return false;" ><strong>Variation Form:</strong></a> a necessary element for your contract,
        defining the
        format for
        formally documenting contract changes.</li>
      <li>Joint Schedule 3 <br><a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#" onclick="return false;" ><strong>Insurance Requirements:</strong></a> an essential schedule that
        captures the
        supplier’s basic
        obligations in respect of required insurances at the framework level, and mandating that the supplier must
        provide any additional insurances that you specify in your Order Form.</li>
      <li>Joint Schedule 4 <br><a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#" onclick="return false;" ><strong>Commercially Sensitive Information:</strong></a> you should ask
        your supplier to tell
        you if any
        of the information they provided is commercially sensitive such that they would not want it disclosed in
        response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request. The response will provide the content for this schedule
        but
        ultimately it will be your decision as to whether the relevant information would be withheld if a pertinent
        FOI
        request was received.</li>
      <li>Joint Schedule 5 <br><a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#" onclick="return false;" ><strong>Corporate Social Responsibility:</strong></a> this is a core
        schedule that sets out
        basic
        corporate social responsibility (CSR) or /social value requirements applicable to all suppliers in the
        Framework. You may have your own CSR or social value requirements to be included in your contract where you
        have
        specified as part of a competition that these must be satisfied.</li>
      <li>Joint Schedule 6 <br><a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#" onclick="return false;" ><strong>Key Sub-Contractors</strong> [Optional]:</a> this will only be
        required where the
        supplier uses
        one or more key-subcontractors to fulfil its obligations under your contract.</li>
      <li>Joint Schedule 7 <br><a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#" onclick="return false;" ><strong>Financial Difficulties</strong> [Optional]:</a> this Schedule will
        apply in relation
        to the
        assessment of the financial standing of the Monitored Companies and the consequences of a change to that
        financial standing.</li>
      <li>Joint Schedule 8 <br><a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#" onclick="return false;" ><strong>Guarantee </strong>[Optional]:</a> you may choose to use this
        schedule where the
        financial status
        of your supplier is such that you want the assurance provided by a third party guarantor that the supplier’s
        obligations will be performed.</li>
      <li>Joint Schedule 10 <br><a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#" onclick="return false;" ><strong>Rectification Plan:</strong></a> an essential schedule that
        defines the format for
        any
        rectification plan that your supplier may have to provide in the event that you experience a supplier default.
      </li>
      <li>Joint Schedule 11 <br><a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#" onclick="return false;" ><strong>Processing Data:</strong></a> this schedule is needed to address
        any processing of
        personal data
        associated with the performance of your contract. Normally, in terms of data protection rules the buyer will
        be
        the controller, specifying the purpose and means of processing personal data; while the supplier will be the
        processor, carrying out such processing under the instructions of the controller. Under such circumstances you
        will need to clearly set out the processing of personal data that you authorise the supplier to undertake in
        the
        data processing template provided in the schedule.
        <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Under certain circumstances the buyer and the supplier may determine that they have a joint controller
            relationship in respect of the processing of certain personal data in relation to an order contract. Where
            this is the case Annex 2 of the schedule must be used to govern such a relationship, and the data to which
            such a relationship applies must be documented in the data processing template.
          </li>
          <li>Finally, there may be circumstances under which, for certain personal data, the supplier will maintain
            that they will be the controller without the buyer being either a joint controller or processor. Under
            such
            circumstances this should be reflected in the completed data processing template.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Joint Schedule 12 <br><a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#" onclick="return false;" ><strong>Supply Chain Visibility</strong> [Optional]:</a> this schedule
        will be used if you
        wish to
        require your Supplier to advertise Sub-Contract Opportunities throughout the duration of your contract.
